# Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST dataset

1. MNIST dataset is taken from keras directly
2. These numerical digits are written by hand from 0 to 9.
3. Simple Neural network is built to recognising these numerical digits
4. Set of best hyperparameters is derived by performing grid search cross validation.

#### Future Tasks:
1. Using CNN to improve the accuracy
2. Compare the performance of NN and CNN
